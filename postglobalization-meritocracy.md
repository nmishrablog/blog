I am a huge believer in the power of free and fair markets. Let me say that again FREE and FAIR. Currents trends would suggest that we have a market that is mostly free but not fair\(at least in the knowledge work market\). People are trying to solve this problem and keep running to the dichotomy of keeping the market both free and fair. Some solutions include Hire.bid , Work Market, Freelancer/Upwork and for the cryptofreaks 21.co.\(I am playing my hand with [Crowdraising.co](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crowdraising.co%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF7q2LL-50OWkXZCKt4ZjtahJKA-Q)\).

Imagining a world where anyone \( who has the skill and incentive\) can from any point on the planet \(maybe not on the planet as well…CC Elon Musk\) can contribute to any project and get rewarded for it. Isn’t that great? Well lets see if/ how great it is.

1. Increased access to knowledge work providers means, geographical arbitrage for price will cause huge value flows to providers that can adapt, leaving those who can’t blaming their local government \(which doesn’t scale to this type of work\) and causing huge political unrest.
2. Non local knowledge worker doing quality work, brings into question the local education system which is not geared for this kind of work.
3. Increase in piece meal education systems like M.O.O.Cs and Digital Certificate programs ,will further erode the sheen of Ivy League institutions.
4. Access to the distribution mechanism i.e. the internet will become the requirement to earn a living. \( with its monopoly providers and issues with neutrality\)

Having sufficiently scared you, let me give you some pros of such a market place?

1. Huge reduction in the cost of information work
2. Reduction in Bullshit titles at the low and high ends of the spectrum with some bloat in the middle \( Thought leader anyone?\)
3. Huge increase in opportunity to the meritorious.

The need of the hour will be if/how the powers that be in the knowledge economy, work with local non-scalable governments to help ease the transition. \(There is an example of a code school in Kentucky doing wonderful things with the careers of Ex-Miners.\) The following are ways I see these entities softening the blow

1. Lobbying for incentives to people wanting to break in to this economy.
2. Creation of education systems at all age/skill levels to address the gap in education.
3. Profit sharing with communities that are dis-proportionally affected by this change.
4. Push for initiatives like Universal Basic Income.
5. Push for increase in non-stem education and professions where the presence of a human is required.

We live in interesting times where an increase in a triumvirate of technologies i.e.

1. Micro-payments facilitated by decentralized ledger systems
2. Task automation by intelligent agents \( both physical and software\)
3. Societal acceptance of non standard earning and education.

is pushing work \(especially information work in a direction which most of us are not ready for. Let us hope we can make this transition peaceful,pragmatic and profitable.

Me and my team at [Crowdraising.co](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crowdraising.co%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF7q2LL-50OWkXZCKt4ZjtahJKA-Q) are thinking about these problems deep and hard. We are working along with others in this industry to make the best of this transition. Come see what we are doing and support us.
