## DAO {#h.p_pThVnEVE2v-G}

TL;DR – Shouldn’t Public companies run like the D.A.O? Was that not the public safety aspect of companies going public? and the promise of easy capital raises? Think of it as **Public Company with infinite transparency.** The main difference is a single public company cannot be so open in its scope of operations that there is almost infinite scope.

At the time of writing this article the D.A.O has raised ~$200MM USD. Thinking about the D.A.O as a VC firm is intuitive but not logical. What is stopping people doing a distributed organisation in USD or any FIAT currency?\(Regulation & Fees I know but we can make that table stakes \).

It is a great experiment to make an organization so open that all decisions can be made logically \( by data \) and consensus. Organizations in the real world succeed and fail based on internal politics. Opening that Kimono so to speak , presents a huge opportunity for productivity and candor. There is a chance for populism to take hold and decisions made to be in conflict with the overall direction\( if such a thing even exists\).

Portfolio thinking applies well in judging the success or failure of an organisation like this. This is where the comparison to VC makes sense & returns are where the VC comparison falls apart. There are versions of the rules governing it, that will push the identity of the D.A.O between these two ends of a spectrum.

Can there be a similar organization to the D.A.O but in a FIAT currency? Comments welcome.
