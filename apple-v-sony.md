BIG COMPANIES FAIL TO INNOVATE DUE TO COMPETENCE , NOT INCOMPETENCE

Apple’s competence is in putting ungodly sums of money/resources at refining products for delight, but they make said products and said money, at least post Jobs, by supply chain efficiency. This is where Tim Cook shines and Apple is set up the right way to take maximum advantage of that.

Here is the bear case for the iPhone 7 and therefore Apple, given that we are up in arms about the loss of the head phone jack.

* Neither the phone nor the watch \( as they are now \) have little perceivable difference to the current user and

   was able to show as much.
* The $159 Earpods are great but since we will loose them every two minutes , seem like quite the extravagance.
* The 3.5mm jack is ubiquitous and the lightning connector wreaks of authoritarian DRM, the fortification of Apples’ walled garden of money printing Eden.

My Android fanboy outrage will not be satiated until I wax poetic about the list of opportunities that apple could have gone after and still should \( the car, the media deal and the TV\). I shall quell my desire by directing you to the title of this article.

Lets speculate for a second, Apple has at its head a visionary product person \(no offense to Tim Cook\) reigning with the force of equal parts Zeus and Jeffrey Katzenberg what could Apple do ? Here is the bull case for Apple

* Obliterate the phone form factor , put a cellular transceiver in the watch, redesign the earbuds, ala 
  [SGNL](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2Fsgnlstrap%2Fsgnl-make-phone-calls-with-your-fingertip%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFeXduYhMxCpsz0LcFMN4_6-dQLmA)
  . Apple is one of the few ,if not only company that can drag their customer, by their wallet into newer device categories.
* Integrate the Camera tech into either a secondary device or the glasses that you already have a patent for.
* Liberate the customer from the bane of Cable TV providers and deliver us content while creating another revenue stream.
* The car might be a bit much , but will justify their use of “Courage” and put them atop Mount Olympus of Consumer tech.

Can we expect these things from the current Apple of Tim cook and Jony Ive? Lets hope so, for now I am sticking to my Nexus 6.
