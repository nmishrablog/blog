IoT is exploding. Most , if not all of these companies have a data analytics revenue stream which they see as a value add. What customers do not often realize is, that capability sometimes comes at the cost of control. Like the people who were shocked at the fact that their devices [\(Revolv devices](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2016%2Fapr%2F05%2Frevolv-devices-bricked-google-nest-smart-home&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGWNQqZc8aNECBT7q0ibkTjD6qdOA)\) became bricks when Nest shut the company down.
