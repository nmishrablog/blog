## what will disrupt VC? {#h.p_f0Ao4NPr3b9n}

Here are the broad categories of Crowdfunding.

* Donation based
* Pre Sales based/Product based
* Equity based for Accredited Investors
* Equity based for Unaccredited Investors

There are different categories in each of the popular crowdfunding platforms which are types 1,2,3 and there are vertical focused platforms\(Circle Up\)/Geographical focused platforms. Here is what a platform, that wants to “close the door” as Peter Thiel puts it , and be the market leader, should do.

1. Allow multiple types of crowdfunding. Equity and Non Equity.
2. Have proof of contribution always available to investors.
3. Provide single point of contact for the next round investors\( Drag along rights, Underwrite the financial situation\).
4. Facilitate due diligence on companies raising money on the platform.
5. Allow for resource sharing / group buying on legal, compliance and corporate services.
6. Provide recourse and a grief-redressal mechanism for all parties in the transaction.

Is this too much to ask? Will this lead to the platform becoming a full fledged financial services agency ?\( the S.E.C has some strict rules about this\). Time will tell, but this will be the culmination of efforts going into disrupting venture capital and startup financing.
