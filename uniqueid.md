## Earth Unique ID {#h.p_ej8xqTU72eop}

TL;DR – Digital services that affect the real world need a unique ID attached to the entity they are serving.While that may create surveillance and authority issues, the Reward/Risk ratio is large. I propose the entity being sold the service own their ID , which gives them access to said services while retaining some sense of control.

A funny thing happens when you read Isaac Asimov’s the last question, the names of the people/entities keep getting more mathematical as time progresses, \(from Alexander to VJ-23X to Zee Prime\). Which leads me to the following question

**How does a service provider know who they are providing service to?**

How do they know what services a customer uses? How does Google/Facebook/Ad network know what ad to show you? They make a digital identity for you and keep a history of your actions.We have varying degrees of access and ability to control this avatar \( sometimes we are not aware of its existence/Scope \). Customer targeting improves ROI for service providers. By streamlining their services to fit the needs of their customers , they can engage in a way not known before. We are at a time when we have global instant publishing for free – think about that for a second you can reach with little to no effort a large portion of humanity.The internet has made distribution almost free to the end user.

Imagine the largest and most powerful service providers in the world – Governments. How can they improve services to their customers i.e. Citizens? How should they leverage the advances in technology to reach out and solve problems instantaneously. Estonia is already far ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to providing this type of Infrastructure, they are also experimenting with E-Citizenship.

Current trends in technology advancements indicate the growth of private entities providing a subset of these services to a large portion of the human population. Companies are trying to solve issues around Identity security first and then hopefully pivot /expand into providing services.

There are many causes for concern, mainly surveillance, Hollywood has been making dystopian movies \(anyone remember “The Net”?\). There are people coming up with decentralized solutions to avoid these problems \(see Civic from Vinny Lingham\). The actual gains from this type of tech will come when they are applied to real world services and problem solving. Organizations like the Institute for Data Driven Design and others are working on protocols to bring stability to these solutions and make for fine reading.

Imagine deploying these services on an planetary scale, the efficiency gains for our race would be incredible.

Comments welcome.
